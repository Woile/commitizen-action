# commitizen-action

Add [commitizen][cz] incredibly fast into your project!

## Features

- Allow prerelease
- Super easy to setup
- Automatically bump version
- Automatically create changelog
- Update any file in your repo with the new version

Are you using [conventional commits][cc] and [semver][semver]?

Then you are ready to use this github action, the only thing you'll need is the
`.cz.toml` file in your project.

## Usage

1. In your repository create a `.cz.toml` file (you can run `cz init` to create it)
2. Create a `.github/workflows/bumpversion.yaml` with the Sample Workflow

### Minimal configuration

Your `.cz.toml` (or `pyproject.toml` if you are using python) should look like
this.

```toml
[tool.commitizen]
version = "0.1.0"  # This should be your current semver version
```

For more information visit [commitizen's configuration page][cz-conf]

## Sample Workflow

```yaml
name: Bump version

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  bump_version:
    if: "!startsWith(github.event.head_commit.message, 'bump:')"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: "Bump version and create changelog with commitizen"
    steps:
      - name: Check out
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
      - name: Create bump and changelog
        uses: commitizen-tools/commitizen-action@master

## Troubleshooting

### Other actions are not triggered when the tag is pushed

This problem occurs because `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger other
actions [by design][by_design].

To solve it you must use a personal access token in the checkout and the commitizen steps.

Follow the instructions in [commitizen's documentation][cz-docs-ga]

## I'm not using conventional commits, I'm using my own set of rules on commits

If your rules can be parsed then you can build your own commitizen rules, you can
create a new commitizen python package or you can describe it on the `toml` conf itself.
